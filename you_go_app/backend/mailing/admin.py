from django.contrib import admin

# Register your models here.
# If you have custom ModelAdmin classes, ensure you are not overriding methods (like __str__ or __repr__) in your models or admin classes that call themselves recursively.
# Example:
# from .models import MyModel
# @admin.register(MyModel)
# class MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
#     pass
